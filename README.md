## Priority Matrix API - test

Before starting the create-react-app server with `npm start`, you have to create a `src/Auth.js` file with the following content:

```js
const Auth = {
  bearerToken: "Insert token obtained from https://prioritymatrix.com/o/authorized_tokens/",
};
export default Auth;
```
